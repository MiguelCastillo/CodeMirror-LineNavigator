CodeMirror-LineNavigator
========================
Addon to enhance line navigation for CodeMirror via Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right.  The addon will take over the mechanism CodeMirror uses for word navigation so that other addons that depend on "goWordLeft" and "goWordRight" also take advantage of the enhanced behavior.  For example, text selection will automatically take advantage of LineNavigator.
